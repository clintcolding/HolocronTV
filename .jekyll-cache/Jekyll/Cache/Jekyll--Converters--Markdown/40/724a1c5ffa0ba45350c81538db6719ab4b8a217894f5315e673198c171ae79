I"8<p>Welcome! Since youâ€™ve found your way here Iâ€™ll assume that youâ€™ve already been invited and have access to Plex. If Iâ€™m mistaken, you can create a Plex account <a href="https://plex.tv">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-plex">What is Plex?</h2>

<p>Plex is a self managed streaming platform, think Netflix or Hulu. The Plex server youâ€™ve been invited to resides in my closet and is known as the Holocron. I control, manage and curate all content that exists on the Holocron.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/serverpic.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yup thats itâ€¦ painters tape and allâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="why-is-your-server-called-the-holocron">Why is your server called the Holocron?</h2>

<p>Holocrons are ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom that can only be accessed by those skilled in the Force.</p>

<p><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Holocron">Intrigued?</a> Youâ€™re welcome.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-thing-on">Is this thing on?</h2>

<p>Canâ€™t connect and not sure whoâ€™s responsible? <a href="/status">Check on the health of the Holocron!</a></p>

<h2 id="is-it-free">Is it free?</h2>

<p>For you? Ya pretty muchâ€¦the only real gotcha is that mobile streaming from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plex/id383457673">Apple</a> app does require a one time fee ($5).</p>

<p>For me? I obviously purchased hardware and pay for the power/networking related to running it. I also use <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/">Plex Pass</a>, which enables a handful of nifty features, the one youâ€™re using is <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/">hardware transcoding</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re watching from a Windows machine Iâ€™d appreciate it if you installed the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app">Plex for Windows</a> desktop app. Youâ€™ll get more features and streaming requires less resources from my server.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re in a mood and just trying to trigger me, you can also watch from a browser such as Chrome or Firefox, simply visit <a href="https://app.plex.tv">app.plex.tv</a> and login.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re watching on a Smart TV, Roku, FireStick or some other streaming device, youâ€™ll need to install the Plex app for said device and follow the prompts for logging in.</p>

<h2 id="id-like-to-request-content">Iâ€™d like to request contentâ€¦</h2>

<p>Youâ€™re in luck, I have an automated request system called Ombi. Ombi allows you to search Movies and TV Shows and request they be added to Plex. Itâ€™s easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://ombi.clintcolding.com">https://ombi.clintcolding.com</a></li>
  <li>Choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sign in With Plex</code></li>
  <li>Search for the Movie or TV Show</li>
  <li>Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">+Request</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Youâ€™ll recieve an email confirmation when the content is available on Plex.</p>

<h2 id="glad-youre-here">Glad youâ€™re here!</h2>

<p>Thank you for joining an elite squad known as the Specialâ€¦ once you recognized it, you read it in the voice didnâ€™t you?</p>

<p>If you have any issues or more questions, you know where I live.</p>

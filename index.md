title: Holocron (Plex)
---

Welcome! Since you've found your way here I'll assume that you've already been invited and have access to Plex. If I'm mistaken, you can create a Plex account [here](https://plex.tv).

## What is Plex?

Plex is a self managed streaming platform, think Netflix or Hulu. The Plex server you've been invited to resides in my closet and is known as the Holocron. I control, manage and curate all content that exists on the Holocron.

Yup thats it... painters tape and all...

## Why is your server called the Holocron?

Holocrons are ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom that can only be accessed by those skilled in the Force.

[Intrigued?](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Holocron) You're welcome.

## Is this thing on?

Can't connect and not sure who's responsible? [Check on the health of the Holocron!](/status.html)

## Is it free?

For you? Ya pretty much...the only real gotcha is that mobile streaming from the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android&hl=en_US) or [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plex/id383457673) app does require a one time fee ($5).

For me? I obviously purchased hardware and pay for the power/networking related to running it. I also use [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/), which enables a handful of nifty features, the one you're using is [hardware transcoding](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/).

## How do I use it?

If you're watching from a Windows machine I'd appreciate it if you installed the [Plex for Windows](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app) desktop app. You'll get more features and streaming requires less resources from my server.

If you're in a mood and just trying to trigger me, you can also watch from a browser such as Chrome or Firefox, simply visit [app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv) and login.

If you're watching on a Smart TV, Roku, FireStick or some other streaming device, you'll need to install the Plex app for said device and follow the prompts for logging in.

## I'd like to request content...

You're in luck, I have an automated request system called Ombi. Ombi allows you to search Movies and TV Shows and request they be added to Plex. It's easy:

1. Visit [https://ombi.clintcolding.com](https://ombi.clintcolding.com)
2. Choose `Sign in With Plex` 
3. Search for the Movie or TV Show 
4. Click `+Request`

You'll recieve an email confirmation when the content is available on Plex.

## Glad you're here!

Thank you for joining an elite squad known as the Special... once you recognized it, you read it in the voice didn't you?

If you have any issues or more questions, you know where I live.
